# Predicting Shark Presence

<h2>ASSIGNMENT OBJECTIVES:</h2><p></p> Upper level undergraduate students will apply the Machine Learning Life Cycle as they prepare and analyze data related to historic shark attacks. The assignment guides students through the preparation of data and modeling for prediction of near shore shark presence off of the coast of North Carolina and South Carolina. After domain understanding, data will be prepared and visualized from the international shark attack file, along with merged data from weather, moon phase, and prey from online sources. KNN, decision tree and random forest (ensemble) models will be used to predict the near shore presence of sharks. Students will also understand the limitations and bias associated with this preliminary research as they explore improved data collection for great white sharks.</p>

<h2>PREREQUISITES:</h2><p> Introductory knowledge in Statistics, Python, AI and Machine Learning. This assignment can be used as mid-semester assignment in undergraduate data mining, or as a guided assignment at the beginning of the semester in order to stimulate interest in data science and machine learning. The exercise is appropriate for undergraduate students in data mining with an interest in exploring and visualizing data, while three models are developed: Knn, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.</p>

<h2>SOFTWARE:</h2><p>All data and notebooks are provided on a public Github repository. Notebooks open and run in Google Colab.</p>

<h2>START OF ASSIGNMENT:</h2>
<h2>RESEARCH SUMMARY:</h2><p>The objective of this research is to improve our understanding of the presence of sharks during tourist (summer) seasons in middle Atlantic and south eastern coastal waters, specifically North Carolina and South Carolina. The study will focus on the analysis of existing data from the International Shark Attack database, weather and water data from NOAA, calculated moon phase dates, crab and turtle populations. The quantitative analysis on this data will lead to new and interesting knowledge that will ultimately provide the basis for improved data collection and an app providing advanced information on the likelihood of sharks in coastal waters where tourists swim, surf and wade.</p><p>

Final prepared and merged historic data sets are provided to simplify the assignment. Raw data is not provided due to the sensitive nature of some of the data that we have analyzed, for example turtle nesting and false crawl behavior. </p>

<p>To get started, students will open the following Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab (click on link): <br>

UPDATE: This is the preliminary assignment that is designed to introduce students to machine learning with an interesting data set! Current data involves receiver-transmitter sightings on the minute from tagged great white sharks off of the coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Work has been ongoing since Spring 2023, with a paper being developed for submission in early 2025.
